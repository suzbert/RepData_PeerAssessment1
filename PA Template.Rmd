This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Create time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

#Imputing missing values

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

#Create boolean array to identify NAs.  
#Total up the number of TRUEs (Identified NAs).

```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Replace NA with mean of 5-minute interval (already computed).  

sapply(split(data, data$date), function(x) sum(is.na(x$steps)))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset (data) but with the missing data filled in (imputed).

imputed <- data
imputed[na_ID, "steps"] <- rep(daily2$steps, length.out = nrow(data))[na_ID]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Calculate total number of steps per day.
daily_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=imputed, FUN=sum)
```

```{r histtotimput, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
#Create histogram of total number of steps per day.
hist(daily$steps, border = "blue", col = "white", ylim=c(0,50), main="Histogram of total number of steps/day - imputed data",     
     xlab="Total number of steps/day - imputed data")     
```


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Calculate mean and median number of steps per day.
mean(daily$steps)
median(daily$steps)

#Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 

#mean(daily$steps)
#[1] 10766.19
# median(daily$steps)
#[1] 10765


#Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
#No.

#What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

#The chosen method of imputation was mean of 5-minute interval, so it makes sense that:
#1. the overall mean of the "imputed" data would not change
#2. the MEDIAN value (the "middle" value) would get closer to the mean
```

#Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Imputed dataset to be used.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend". 
#This factor indicates whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

imputed$day = weekdays( as.Date(imputed$date, "%Y-%m-%d") )
weekend.values = c("Saturday", "Sunday")
weekend.flag = imputed$day %in% weekend.values
imputed$day[ weekend.flag ] = "Weekend"
imputed$day[ !(weekend.flag) ] = "Weekday"
imputed$day = as.factor(imputed$day)
stepsbyday = ddply(imputed, .(day, interval), summarize, 
                   meansteps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
```


```{r ggplotpanel, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
#Make a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
#and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 

ggplot( stepsbyday, aes(x=interval, y=meansteps)) + geom_line() +
  theme_few() + 
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  facet_grid(day ~ .) + ylab("Number of Steps") +
  xlab("Interval") +
  ggtitle("Imputed Levels: Weekends vs. Weekdays") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.75)))

```

```
#Conclusion based on plots: Yes there are differences in activity patterns.

#On weekdays, there is more concentrated activity, as shown by two aspects of the chart:
#high peak of over 200 steps at interval 835, while at other times of the day, steps taken range from zero to just over 100.  

#On weekends, there is more activity througout the day, 
#as evidenced by several peaks at around 150 steps taken.
